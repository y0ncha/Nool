**Nool** is a modular, AI-ready web application designed to centralize and organize access to Google services such as Calendar, YouTube, and Drive in a single, unified dashboard.  
The project aims to simplify personal content management and task tracking by providing a clear UI powered by React and Material UI, along with a backend that will eventually support intelligent context-aware features.

Built with scalability and modularity in mind, Nool will later integrate an AI assistant capable of understanding user intent, summarizing content, and offering context-based automation across your Google ecosystem.

Currently, the project is in early development with a frontend built using TypeScript, Vite, and MUI, and plans to implement a FastAPI backend with OAuth-based integration to Google services.
